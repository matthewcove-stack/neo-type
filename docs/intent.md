# Intent

Build a modern, browser-playable horizontal shmup inspired by classic arcade shooters (notably R-Type),
focused on **tactical weapon positioning**, **pattern learning**, and **memorable boss fights**.

## Product goals
- Fun within 60 seconds: player can move, shoot, deploy the Drone, and die/respawn.
- Depth within 10 minutes: players learn that Drone placement and charge timing matter.
- A complete vertical slice: 1 polished stage + boss + score/rank loop.

## Player fantasy
Pilot a small, precise strike craft through hostile biomechanical territory, using a detachable Drone
to carve safe paths and set up kills.

## Target platform
- Web (desktop) first: keyboard + optional gamepad.
- Designed for 16:9, scalable to common resolutions.

## Target feel
- Methodical, not frantic: deliberate movement, meaningful positioning.
- High tension: tight spaces, projectile patterns, and risk/reward charge shots.

## Inspiration pillars (must preserve)
1. **Attach/detach weapon pod** (our Drone): front/back/detached as a tactical choice.
2. **Charge shot**: powerful beam with clear commitment window.
3. **Checkpoint learning**: hard but fair, pattern-based progression.
4. **Boss identity**: each boss is a setpiece with weak points and phases.
